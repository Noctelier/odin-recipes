    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
       <ll>Ground beef</ll>
       <li>Seasonings of choice(Tony's, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, etc) </li>
       <li>Buns</li>
       <li>Toppings (Lettuce, tomato, onions, etc)</li>
       <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>First you want to put your ground beef in a bowl and lightly break it up. Then grab some meat and lightly roll into a ball. 

            Donâ€™t pack the meat in a tight ball, it needs to be loosely formed. 
            I did 4 balls from 1 pound meat. Feel free to adjust burger size. </li>
            <p></p>

        <li>Turn your Blackstone on high and let it get nice and hot. Or if you are cooking on a cast iron skillet turn to high, add a little oil and let it get hot. 

            Place burger balls on hot griddle. 
            Searing your burgers really well is key. </li>
            <p></p>

        <li>Then with your burger press, press down firmly to flatten your patties. 
            Sprinkle with seasoning and let cook. We made ours pretty thin. 
            <p></p>
            The thin texture and hot griddle creates a crispy crust texture on the outside of 
            the burger. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Around 3-5 minutes check your burger to see if it is crispy on the bottom, 
            and if so flip, season again, and let the other side crisp up. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Place buns on griddle to toast. Remove buns once a slight golden color. You can butter 
            your buns or drizzle with light oil on grill to help the buns toast. </li>
            <p></p>
    </ol>
